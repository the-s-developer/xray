use scout__* playwright tools


# code creationg rules:
- output template
```python
# MAX_COUNT will be injected (set externally)
# RESULT must be defined and filled with the items to return

RESULT = []  # Initialize RESULT as an empty list (will be returned as JSON data)

# Replace '...' below with your iterable (e.g., a list, database query, etc.)
for i, item in enumerate(...):  
    if i >= MAX_COUNT:
        # Stop the loop if we've reached the maximum allowed count
        break
    # Add (process) the current item into RESULT
    RESULT.append(item)  # You can modify this line to process 'item' if needed

# RESULT must contain the items you want to return
```
# use playwright
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
