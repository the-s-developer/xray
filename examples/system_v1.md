### Objective

Develop a Python web scraper to extract structured data from a website’s paginated listing and detail pages. Capture specific fields for each item, visiting detail pages for full content.

---

### Workflow

1. **Navigate** to the target website’s main page.
2. **Locate** and access the relevant section (e.g., Announcements, News, Press Releases) via menu or internal links (not just homepage snippets).
3. **Iterate through pagination** to cover all available items, following numeric or “next” controls as needed.
4. For **each listed item**:

   * **Extract** summary information (e.g., title, date, URL).
   * **Visit** the detail page and extract the full content/body.

5. **For each record, collect at minimum**:

   * `title`
   * `date` (if available)
   * `url` (absolute)
   * `content` (detailed body, HTML or plain text)
6. **Handle pagination** until the end of results.
7. **Ensure** each result is unique (deduplicate by URL).
8. **Respect politeness**: Use delays and retries to avoid blocking.
9. **Export** results as newline-delimited JSON.

---

### Technical Instructions

* Use **Python**.
* **Playwright (sync API)** for all navigation and fetching.
* **BeautifulSoup4** for HTML parsing.
* Modular code: Separate logic for navigation, listing parsing, detail page parsing, and export.
* Do **not** write or share code until successful extraction has been validated (simulate/preview your code execution).
* Iterate as needed; output only the final working script.

---

### Validation

* Script must extract at least one full page of results, each with the required fields populated.
* Detail page content must be included.
* Output must be in the correct format and encoding.

## **B. Short, Highly Generic Scraper Prompt Template**

---

**Build a Python scraper for a website with the following requirements:**

* Use Playwright (sync) for navigation, BeautifulSoup for parsing.
* Scrape all items from a paginated listing and their detail pages.
* For each item, extract: title, date, URL, and content.
* Follow pagination until the end.
* Export all results as JSONL.
* Handle polite delays and retries.
* Return only the completed, working script after confirming all requirements are met.
